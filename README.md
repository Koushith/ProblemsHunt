## ProblemsHunt? 

Inspired by ProductHunt. running out of ideas? confused about what to build? Problems hunt comes to the rescue. 

people can signup and post any popup ideas.

## why would anyone post their idea if they can build by themself? why would anyone allow to steal their idea which can turn into a SAAS startup?

Even I thought this. but ideas without execution are nothing. the first step is to build an MVP.

I came across generous genuine people who have great ideas and don't have time to work on it. they share it publically. I'm targeting those users.

Plot twist- the app should have upvoting- anyone can build the application based on the same idea, but execution matters. the one who manages to finish the task will be featured on the top.

also other submissions as well. we can have a poll to check which version is better..
